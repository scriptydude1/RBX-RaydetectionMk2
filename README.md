# Raydetection MK 2 - Module for hit detection.
### **Raycast-Based Hitboxes Module.**
My new and improved version of my old "Raydetection" module.  In development.

Some may ask: *"Why this when you can do :GetPartsInPart?"* 
Firstly, I like to reinvent the wheels. Secondly, this thing is sloow.

### Features (TODO):

 - *Multiple Modes*
     **Directional** and **Omni-Directional**
     
 - *Good Perfomance*
 - *Intended for clientside use. Still useable on server*
 - TODO readme file and more features
